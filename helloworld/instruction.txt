************Functional review********************

Review requirement understanding of developer, check if person missed any use case
Check if the functionality is working as per mentioned in the requirements
Review the screen if there is any usability mistake


***********************Business Logic Review**************************

Check if code is readable (tab spacing, variable names, function names, urls)
Check if there is any unwanted code (commented code, unused variables or functions, debug logs)
Does code follows coding standards (it should be related to project)
Code should follow as much as SOLID principles (Single responsibility has to follow)
Check if there is any redundant code, generally people used to copy and paste logic rather than creating common function
Functions should have validation before storing data into database or sending to server API
Form or input values should be type cast
Code should handle positive and negative scenarios (if paramters are invalid code should return error else it should process as per expectation)
Error handling should be handle on client side (e.g. Ajax or Angular HTTP requests)
Check the database changes (indexes, table structure, field types, joins)
Check if the sensitive data is stored in plain text (like password, tokens)
If there is payment transaction happening then it should be on HTTPS request
Try to avoid loops and complex logic
